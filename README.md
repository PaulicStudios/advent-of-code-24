# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This project contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, written in Go.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. Each day, a new challenge is released, and participants can solve it using any programming language of their choice.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `day01/`: Solutions for Day 1 challenge
- `day02/`: Solutions for Day 2 challenge
- ...
- `day25/`: Solutions for Day 25 challenge

Each directory contains the Go code for the corresponding day's challenge.

## How to Run

To run a specific day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and use the following command:

```sh
go run dayXX/main.go
